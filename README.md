## API Endpoints

These guidelines aim to support a truly RESTful API. Here are a few exceptions:
* Put the version number of the API in the URL (see examples below). Donâ€™t accept any requests that do not specify a version number.
* Allow users to request formats like JSON or XML like this:
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.xml
